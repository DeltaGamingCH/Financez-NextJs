# Financez
A financing app built with NextJs from the original project [Financez](https://github.com/DeltaGamingCH/FINANCEZ).

## Documentation
Documentation of the project is not public, found on Notion. 

## Purpose
I've been looking for an application that allows me to track my finances, separate to my e-banking but couldn't find a solution that I like. 
To learn React and NextJs, I have decided this would be the perfect way to learn a new framework and build something I would use.
